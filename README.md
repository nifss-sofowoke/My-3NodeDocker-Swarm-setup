# My-3NodeDocker-Swarm-setup
As a follow up to the **EC2-Docker-Setup** this repo contains an AWS CloudFormation template on setting up a 3-node Docker Swarm.
This template would automatically launch 2 additional EC2 instances (nodes) with Docker installed, in addition to the previous node used to setup the Docker environment.

# Project Documentation
This is the link to my project that includes a step-by-step guide on how I set up and configured my 3-node Docker Swarm and then deployed an Nginx service with the swarm.
